# Submit

Here you can submit your solutions to the problems in your module. Take note:

- Make sure that the zip file you hand in contains **the entire `module 6` directory** (including the `functional` package, `list_words.py`, `classify_unigram.py`, and `classify_bigram.py`).

- You may submit and re-submit without limit up until the deadline. However, each time you submit, you need to submit all problems at once.

- In case of problems submitting, ask your teacher or send an e-mail to <scientific@uva.nl>.
