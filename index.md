# News

In this module you will write a program that can determine the main topics of a newspaper article. This might seem like a very specific application, but the underlying problem (text classification) is one that you will encounter a lot in practice. Is a text positive or negative? Is it pro-democrat or pro-republican? Or, as in our case, is it about politics or about entertainment (or both)?

A secondary goal of this module is to focus a bit more on program design and style a bit more then usual. You will learn how to use some functional design principles. And you will learn how to make your code modular and how to document it properly.
